/*
 * Uniracers — desktop host shim.
 *
 * Identity and hooks, nothing else. The host itself is the framework's
 * (snesrecomp/runner/src/desktop/host_main.h): the pre-boot launcher, ROM
 * resolution and digest checks, config.ini and keybinds.ini, the window and
 * the SDL / OpenGL presenters, audio, gamepads, the in-game save-state
 * browser and rewind filmstrip, the OSD, the pacing clock, crash handlers and
 * the post-mortem report, mod packages, Generate & rebuild, and the netplay
 * barrier when the project is built with it. A fix there reaches this
 * project on a submodule pull; nothing in this file needs to change for it.
 *
 * This file used to BE the host -- a ~700-line copy made at scaffold time --
 * so every project scaffolded before a fix kept the bug. Two ports of the
 * same game, a week apart, had different hosts.
 *
 * Nothing here ever ships a ROM. The player supplies one; the host makes
 * that easy (launcher, then positional argument, then a copy beside the
 * executable, then the rom.cfg cache, then a file picker) and checks what it
 * is handed against the digests in rom_identity.txt.
 *
 * Grow this file only with what is specific to THIS title: a custom
 * presenter (prepare_frame / draw_frame), an SPC player, a pacing rule
 * (keep_pacing_debt), a Mods provider. See SnesDesktopHostGame for the
 * complete list of hooks and what each is for.
