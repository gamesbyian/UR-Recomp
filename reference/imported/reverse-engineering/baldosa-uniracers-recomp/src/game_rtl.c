/*
 * Uniracers — per-game runtime glue.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS THE PORT. Everything else the scaffold produced is layout,
 * build wiring, and packaging; this is where the actual work happens.
 *
 * The framework does not, and cannot, drive an arbitrary SNES game on its
 * own. Two responsibilities always land on the game host:
 *
 *   1. Deciding what "one frame" means for THIS title, and returning from
 *      run_frame() at that boundary. A real ROM's reset vector never
 *      returns — it enters a main loop that waits on vblank — so somebody
 *      has to choose the yield point.
 *   2. Delivering NMI/IRQ at the hardware edge (see
 *      snesrecomp/docs/FRAME_MODEL_HOSTS.md).
 *
 * A new port starts on the framework's beam-aligned driver
 * (runner/src/beam_frame_driver.h): one frame is one PPU field, cut at the
 * beam's vblank edge; interrupts -- raster splits and a coprocessor's IRQ
 * line -- are taken where the beam latches them; parked time still runs the
 * beam, APU and coprocessors; and the field is rasterized from the raster
 * journal with real HDMA. It is the framework's, so a fix to it reaches this
 * port on a submodule pull.
 *
 * This file used to hold its own copy of a simpler driver: frames measured
 * from wherever the CPU last stopped, NMI delivered at an arbitrary beam
 * position, the field drawn with end-of-frame register state. A game that
 * uploads in vblank between INIDISP=$80 and $0F flickered black, and one
 * that chains raster splits fell apart. Replace these calls only for what
 * the driver does not do; MetalWarriorsSNESRecomp's src/mw_rtl.c and
 * GundamWingEndlessDuelSNESRecomp's src/game_rtl.c are developed examples of
 * title-specific drivers.
