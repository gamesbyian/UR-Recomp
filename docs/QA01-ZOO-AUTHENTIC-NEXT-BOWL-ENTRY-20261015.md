# QA-01: authentic 2014 Zoo-to-Bowl *next active race* handoff

**Owner:** original/native gameplay verification, QA-01/07. **Status:** opt-in producer and unit contract implemented; real source/native three-clock experiment is separately qualified. **Zero USA complete-event credit.**

## Decision-changing gap

The [RF-017 corrected-SRAM original/native Zoo evidence](QA01-RF017-CORRECTED-SOURCE-ZOO-20261015.md) proves matching observed menu/course/race state on all **31 original/native guest-relative +5156..+5186 frames**, plus **six exact full battery SRAM pairs** and a 25.10-second MIKE best lap. But the existing producer stops its genuine 2014 controller-window playback after **result+80** and collects its final SRAM image at +72. This reaches Crawler's next track menu (`0x16`) but **not the next actual course entry**.

The pinned, fully traced 2014 SMV enters the following **Crawler Bowl** race at original movie frame **8620**, 267 frames after genuine Zoo Circuit result frame **8353**. This is already established by the original Bowl source event and must be reconfirmed against the full archived movie, rather than inferred from a menu item.

## Smallest existing-tool continuation

The opt-in `--zoo-next-bowl`, valid only for the pinned native/actual Zoo case with `--source-followthrough`, extends the **same** original movie controller window to at least result +280. No input mask, duration, frame rebase, savestate or game execution change. Its replay script appends exact guest-relative samples at **+259, +263, +265, +266, +267, +268, +269, +272, +276 and +280** after the existing +72 full-SRAM checkpoint. The dense +265..+269 subset can identify a one-frame next-course entry without calling any isolated active snapshot the first frame.

- The actual original reference movie source must independently prove continuous Bowl `track=2, in_race=1` at movie frames **8620..8627**, preceded by a non-Bowl-active frame at **8619**, and retain `menu/track/in_race` at every requested movie offset. Missing or contradictory original source is an error, never a guessed timestamp.
- Fresh **Snes9x** and **Baldosa** must each supply a complete 128 KiB guest WRAM and 8 KiB SRAM image, with every scripted dump host frame equal to **its own calibrated race entry + its own observed Zoo result onset + offset**. Their two host-frame axes and reset-anchored 2014 movie frames remain distinct.
- The observer reports all exact original/source/fresh native named-state triplets, the first **adjacently witnessed** Bowl active entry in each guest, full original/native SRAM hashes, MIKE's earned **2510-centisecond** Zoo ranked record/holder, score checksum and mismatching indices as negative science rather than exceptions.
- Missing guest dumps, wrong frame receipts, invalid SRAM length and fabricated original movie next entry **fail closed**; a genuine gameplay mismatch produces a report with `next_bowl_entry_triple_equal=false`, not admission.

The existing `qa01-event-campaign.yml` remains **manual/reusable only**, with an opt-in `zoo_next_bowl` input requiring `selected=zoom-zoo` and `source_followthrough=true`. It reuses the exact Snes9x/Baldosa binaries and baseline source-input producer, adding no second runner, automatic research factory or 45-course census. Synthetic tests defend masks, source/handoff guest clocks, actual 8KiB files, negative native course phase and release credit.

## Interpretation, stop, ownership

A positive observed next entry can support the first *complete post-result gameplay handoff* from Zoom Zoo into Bowl on this candidate. It does **not** by itself prove exact full WRAM or CPU instruction equivalence, whole movie, live two-player, actual Windows executable source identity, Windows filesystem autosave/hard kill or physical release readiness. Any imperfect new-race entry is a targeted original/native gameplay discrepancy; never change original controller timing merely to produce equality. CPU/APU clock implementation belongs to Agent 5. Independent Windows release QA alone may award the 12 release-quality gates, and the official complete-USA-event counter remains **0/45** until all independently required witnesses are accepted.

Stop after one successful source-qualified three-axis next Bowl entry under the corrected RF-017 candidate; only expand event families after the single strict complete event is independently admitted.
